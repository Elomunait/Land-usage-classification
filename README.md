# Land Usage Classification in Agriculture

## Abstract

This repository explores the classification of land use types using aerial and satellite photographs of the earth's surface. The project focuses on creating photo masks based on ready-made masks and visualizing them on the screen.

## Introduction

Determining how land is used is a significant challenge with implications for both economic and natural disasters due to improper and illegal land use. This project addresses this issue by leveraging the analysis of aerial and satellite images. The key goal is to build a mathematical model capable of determining land use types based on color analysis. By utilizing artificial intelligence and big data methods, the project aims to develop a robust model-classifier.

## Materials and Methods

The statistical data used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/humansintheloop/semantic-segmentation-of-aerial-imagery) under the CC0: Public Domain license.
